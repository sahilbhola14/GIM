# Generalizable Information-theoretic Modeling
The goal is to develop generalizable models by exploring Information-theoretic measures such as Mutual-Information, R-D theory, Information bottleneck, etc.
We aim to use these measures to combine difference sources of information such as experiments, numerical simulations, and emerical modeling.
